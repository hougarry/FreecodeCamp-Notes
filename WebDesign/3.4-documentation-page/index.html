                <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to create web pages. HTML documents contain a head and a body. The head contains information about the document that is not displayed on the page, such as the page title. The body contains the information that is displayed. HTML documents can be styled using CSS, which is a language that tells the browser how to display the HTML elements on the page. CSS can be written in the same document as the HTML, or in a separate file. JavaScript can also be used to affect HTML elements on the page. JavaScript can be written in the same document as the HTML, or in a separate file.</p>

                <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to style HTML elements on the page. CSS can be written in the same document as the HTML, or in a separate file. CSS rules consist of a selector and a declaration. The selector tells the browser which HTML elements to style, and the declaration tells the browser how to style the elements. CSS declarations consist of a property and a value. The property is the style to be applied, and the value is the setting for the style. Multiple CSS declarations can be applied to the same selector by separating them
