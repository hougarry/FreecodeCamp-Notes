1.Create a body selector and give it a font-family set to Open Sans with a fallback of sans-serif.? 
```
body {
  font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
}
```

 fallback means  a secondary or backup option that is used when the primary choice is not available or supported.

 2. structure of css:  margin/border/padding, height/content/width/. mbp,hcw(mackbookpro, hey, can't wait)

3. In HTML, if an element has the `class` attribute set to "logo," you would target it in CSS using the class selector `.logo`:

```css
/* CSS for elements with class="logo" in HTML */
.logo {
  /* Your styles here */
}
```

If an element has the `id` attribute set to "logo," you would target it in CSS using the ID selector `#logo`:

```css
/* CSS for an element with id="logo" in HTML */
#logo {
  /* Your styles here */
}
```

The class selector (`.classname`) is used to target multiple elements with the same class, while the ID selector (`#idname`) is used to target a single unique element with a specific ID.
